# AlchemyNftDisplayTutorial

## A short tutorial showing how to use Alchemy SDK to pull NFTs for Display from a specific address

The tutorial is inspired by the tutorial on how to display NFTs from Alchemy Docs
https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-get-all-nfts-owned-by-an-address

The codebase is built on top of the NEXT.js images with-cloudinary template
https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cloudinary

The focus is on using Alchemy-SDK for JS 
But the project is built on 
Next.js
Tailwind
and 
AlchemySDK

The code is a bit slapdash but some suggested improvements is a text box to accept different addresses
a way to resolve ENS's and and infinite scroll mechanism for accounts with large NFT galleries.
